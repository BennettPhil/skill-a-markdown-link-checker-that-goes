# Purpose
Implement the idea: a markdown link checker that goes through a markdown file (or folder of them) and checks if all the links are still alive. dead links in docs are the worst

# Context
No additional context provided.

# Builder Influence
Use a concise, validation-first workflow derived from the selected builder guidance: --- name: example-first-builder description: A builder that generates Agent Skills by creating concrete usage examples first, then building the implementation to support them. version: 0.1.0 license: Apache-2.0 ---

# Workflow
1. Clarify assumptions and constraints before implementation.
2. Produce a concrete implementation plan tied to the requested output.
3. Build the solution incrementally and verify each major step.
4. Add usage instructions and edge-case handling notes.
5. Validate outputs and report limitations explicitly.

# Validation Checklist
- Output files match the task and are runnable.
- Input validation and error handling are explicit.
- Instructions include test or verification steps.
- Any unsafe or illegal request is redirected to a safe alternative.
